Best case to search in BST is O(logn).
Best case possible only in Balnced Binary Tree.
Worst case is O(h).

If a recursive function uses a global (or class-level) variable to store results, 
it can just update that variable in each call and doesn’t need to return anything, 
because all calls share the same variable.

But if the function doesn’t use a shared variable and instead needs to send
 a value back from the deeper recursive calls, it must return the result, 
 so the answer can travel back up the recursion chain.
